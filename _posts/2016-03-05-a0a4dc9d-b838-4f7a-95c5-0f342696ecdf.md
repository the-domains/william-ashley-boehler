3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, 1448 sq ft on a little over 5,000 sq ft lot. This home is located in the Jefferson Park HPOZ towards the east side off Western Ave. 

This home offers original wood flooring, and historically correct bathroom tile choices. The bathrooms and kitchen have been renovated with a modern twist offering marble counter tops and a beautiful bathtub off the master bedroom. A rare walk in closet offers the next owner a little extra convienience over a more original craftsman home. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/24759fbe-9193-46ea-a478-04995ed28e8e.jpg)

Behind the kitchen is a laundry room porch area, with access to the backyard. Beautiful trees drape the backyard in shade, while the added wood paneled deck offers a perfect opportunity for outdoor living space. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/283e39dc-a196-4943-87c8-5bf453daee13.jpg)

As you turn left from the kitchen, towards the master bedroom, you will find a perfect office/studio space area. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/82c5eea7-61fa-4c5d-9776-45866d4ef29e.jpg)

All of this adds up to a great flip Craftsman. Although prices continue to rise in the HPOZ, this one is priced fairly compared to some of the recent sales. For buyers that value the modern touches this renovation offers, it will be love at first sight. For more traditionalists', this home may be too modernized. No one will argue that Jefferson Park is rapidly becoming one of the most desirable neighborhoods in all of Los Angeles for under a million dollars. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9d3dffcc-bbe5-4f94-91c6-5fb250c80f09.jpg)

Westsiders and move-up buyers are betting big on this mid-city adjacent area to become the next Culver City/Silverlake/Echo Park. All signs point to that being a safe bet. Open houses are packed every weekend. Homes are flying off the market in a matter of days with multiple offers on all of them. Gentrification is alive and well all over the mid-city Los Angeles area.
