The price setter - Chesterfield Square flip home sets record price 

The property at 1809 W 43rd Pl was the biggest price tag offered in the neighborhood of ALL TIME. This amazing bungalow is in a beautiful pocket on South Los Angeles just under the hottest neighborhoods of the last 2 years Jefferson Park and West Adams. 

Buyer demand has been fierce for these Craftsman and Bungalow homes and the designer and builders did an incredible job mixing Restoration Hardware industrial flair with Crate and Barrel style softer influences. From the exposed beams in the living room, to the studio loft carved out of the pitched roof the homes are known for; this masterpiece delivered the highest selling price in the entire zip code by over $100,000\.

West Los Angeles, known for its insanely high prices and even higher buyer demand has started to soften at the entry level of around a million dollars and many of those buyers have decided to occupy the Gentrification zone that is mid-city Los Angeles. Although mid-city is predominately north of I-10, the lines have shifted as the Jefferson Park, West Adams, Windsor Hills, Leimert Park, and View Park areas continue to grow. 

To westside buyers, and more recently NE LA buyers priced out of their current neighborhoods, this mid-city area of Los Angeles has become the hottest real estate in town. The numbers are in, and WOW is the only word to describe what we are seeing in the offers for these unique homes. 

Many of the homes listed recently have been sold in under 10 days, with multiple offers for WELL over asking price. Gentrification of the area is shattering expectations rapidly with over 100 renovated homes sold in the past 6 months all scratching out slightly higher numbers than the one before. Cost per square foots are averaging an astounding $500+.

If you are a lifelong LA resident, it may be suprising to read about the explosion that is happening in these neighborhoods. In reality, the location of these homes has always deserved the attention it is finally receiving. Where else can you live in Los Angeles and be so centrally located. Imagine being able to go from your home to Hollywood, Santa Monica, or the arts district of Downtown Los Angeles in 15 minutes with minimal traffic or 30 minutes in the worst? For many Angelenos, our proximity to work and social functions controls our quality of life. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5951d1f0-f9b2-4725-95a4-e1e012dcafda.jpg)
