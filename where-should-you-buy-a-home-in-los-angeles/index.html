I get calls/emails from around the world weekly asking about specific properties and neighborhoods. The most common price range I hear is $500,000. It seems to be a comfortable number for most dual income buyers I work with and is really the starting point for a single family home throughout most of Los Angeles. I thought we should take some time, discuss expectations, and let you see exactly what some price ranges look like throughout the city.  4131 S Harvard Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90062 – $449,000  Pending in only 8 days on the market    I work non-stop. I see tons of homes. If you are looking at it online in the 500k price point; yes I have already seen it, yes I will tell you all about it. Its important to work with an agent that KNOWS the inventory available both on and off the market. </p><p>The best homes sell quickly. 3-10 days in the hottest neighborhoods like Mount Washington, Glassell Park, and West Adams. If your agent doesn’t know the inventory, you won’t get the house. There is always someone willing to pay a little more than you in the Los Angeles real estate market.  5372 Village Grn Los Angeles, CA 90016 – Only 2 days back on the market and with another offer already on the property we were able to structure a winning deal and net an under list price deal. Village Green is a beautiful historic property offering acres of landscaped lawns and mid century condo styles in the heart of Los Angeles, CA. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8d551780-8cc9-49a3-b8e9-0599c4e7754c.jpg"><p> The most exciting part of my job is seeing my clients’ eyes light up when we find the perfect home. I’m always looking at body language, facial expressions, etc to gauge how I did on picking out homes to match their style. When I see you start lingering a little longer in each room, and touching walls, fixtures, etc. I know we are on the right track style wise.  I typically connect with clients while they are searching for homes for sale in Los Angeles online. Sometimes they already know what part of the city they want to live in, but many times they are shopping for the best house they can find in a certain price point. As I mentioned earlier, the most common price I hear is $500,000. Depending on mortgage rates, down payments, etc you can expect a $3200/month total payment on a traditional first time buyer FHA loan in the current market conditions at that price. (obviously this changes daily, but a good reference point). This payment includes the principle balance, interest, property taxes, homeowners insurance, PMI and assumes a 3.5% down payment of $17,500. </p><p>If you are looking in certain parts of the city where the median income is lower, there is program offered by BBVA Compass HOME mortgage that offers a zero down, zero pmi, low closing cost loan to qualified buyers. Contact me for more details on that loan program. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3f6d8bf8-2f03-4b2f-af9c-027721c54c6e.jpg"><p> 4576 W 23rd St Los Angeles, CA 90016 – 24 hours after price drop, we structured a winning deal on this beautiful West Adams home beating multiple offers and netting an under list price deal for wonderful clients buying their first home in Los Angeles.    Neighborhoods of interest:  West Adams: Known for its eclectic mix of craftsman, bungalows, spanish and modern designs; this is the mid-city version of Silverlake or Mount Washington. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b1b27e62-d94b-4557-ba50-305c920b1209.jpg"><p>Gentrification is still in full swing, but this is a centrally located pocket of the city that was overlooked for many years. There are still a lot of multi-family properties in the area, but the streets are clean, the neighbors are wonderful, and restaurants and shops are opening nearby constantly. Commuting to the west side, downtown Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, or even the San Fernando Valley is easily done from here.  $500,000 will get you a beautiful bungalow, or spanish style home with roughly 1,000 sq feet. These are typically well thought out, unique properties. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/826bc3d3-02b7-4ce6-85fe-9ba9b666c6a0.JPG"><p>The metro line running through Exposition Blvd at the south side of the neighborhood will bring even more attention to this area in the next few years. Prices in West Adams are still rising, but could be booming by 2018 as Los Angeles transitions to a fully function public transportation system. This is certainly a neighborhood to watch for the future.  This home on Victoria Avenue in West Adams is in escrow, likely over the $599,999 asking price in a matter of days.    Beautiful spanish/santa fe style home just south of Pico in the heart of West Adams, Los Angeles, CA 90016.    Glassel Park/Mount Washington – Highland Park: I’m sure the residents of the area would tell you otherwise but these neighborhoods have such a similar feel that I group them all together. Typically if a buyer is shopping in one of these areas we are looking at everything nearby. </p><p>500k used to get a fantastic bungalow home in any of these neighborhoods but the gentrification of the area has brought new coffee shops, bars, restaurants, and entertainment options that weren’t here previously and prices are on the rise still. The starting point in this neighborhood is in the upper 200 range for condos and townhouses with single family bungalows starting in the low-mid 400,000 range. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/45d88f19-b09c-42d4-9c67-cf9ae04d823c.jpg"><p>Expect a home under 900 sq feet for anything under $500,000.  Fantastic bungalow in Glassell Park, Los Angeles, CA 90065    Amazing craftsman home in Highland Park, Los Angeles, CA 90042    Mid-City, South Los Angeles and Inglewood: All of these neighborhoods were once associated with negative stereotypes. </p><p>As prices rise, the areas clean themselves up and prices are certainly on the rise in Inglewood and South Los Angeles. Once a place for gang violence, the subject of gangster rap, and generally undesirable area has become an “up and coming neighborhood” of the Los Angeles metro area. Buyers began to realize that Inglewood was as far west as you could go without paying hefty premiums associated with the beach cities like Santa Monica, Marina, Venice, and others. They also found out that as long as you go far enough south, north of Carson, and Downey, South Los Angeles homes are actually really nice and fantastic values compared to just a mile or two to the north. </p><p>If you are searching for affordable homes in Los Angeles but need family friendly neighborhoods with good schools I am more than happy to help.  Bungalow on W 111th St had the busiest open house I have ever seen on a renovated property. Pending in days with offers the first hour of being on the market. This will no doubt close over asking price in the 425k range.          </p><p>Multiple Offers: I know its frustrating to find a home you really like, submit an offer and find out that someone paid a little bit more, had better financing terms, or in some cases waived all contingencies to purchase a property. There is no secret formula to winning multiple offers but a good agent will guide you and advise you through the process. No one wants to lose a house they love over a couple thousand dollars, but waving your rights as a buyer to do perform due-diligence can become a recipe for disaster with costly consequences. Reach out today if you need help finding the perfect Los Angeles home.  5005 5th Ave Los Angeles, CA 90043 – Less than 2 weeks on the market. </p><p>We won multiple offers, netting the buyer a lower than list price contract on a very popular home just south of Mid-City Los Angeles. The buyer also qualified for a zero down payment, no pmi, and low closing cost loan program even though she made significantly more than the median Los Angeles salary. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/73c3b1e2-d130-42b7-84b4-0fe7e164262f.jpg"><p> 320 S Ardmore Ave Los Angeles, CA 90020 – With only 48 hours on the market we were able to negotiate an under asking price contract on this Koreatown condo unit before the first open house and secure this property without competition and multiple offers.
